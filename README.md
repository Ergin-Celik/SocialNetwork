# SocialNetwork

This is a front-end project written to demonstrate my knowledge in ReactJS and Typescript.

Here are the concepts that have been used :

- Typescript
- Routing (react router)
- Functional and/or Class components
- Props and states
- React's Context API
- Hooks (useState, useEffect,...)
- Axios - HTTP calls to an API
- Infinite feed with pagination
- SCSS

This app is a fake facebook-like website that implements an infinite news feed and allows the user to open the posts and read the comments.

This is 'fake', because some test data comes from a free-to-use API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
