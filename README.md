# SocialNetwork

This is a front-end project written to demonstrate my knowledge in ReactJS and Typescript.

Here are the concepts that have been used :

- Typescript
- Routing (react router)
- Functional and/or Class components
- Props and states
- React's Context API
- Hooks (useState, useEffect,...)
- Axios - HTTP calls to an API (Test API used : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- Infinite feed with pagination
- SCSS
